\chapter{Example Systems}\label{ch:systems}

Reservoir computers are most useful as tools for answering questions
about dynamic systems, such as state inference and
forecasting. Throughout this dissertation, I use many small chaotic systems
for example RC tasks. For reference, they are included here.

\section{Lorenz '63}\label{sec:lorenz}

  \label{fig:lorenz}
\end{figure}

The Lorenz '63 chaotic system is described by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \dot{x} &= \sigma \left(y - x\right), \\
    \dot{y} &= x \left(\rho - z\right) - y, \\
    \dot{z} &= x\,y - \beta z,
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:lorenz}
\end{equation}
with standard parameters $\sigma = 10$, $\rho = 28$, and $\beta = 8/3$~\cite{lorenz1963}. The attractor of this
system in \cref{fig:lorenz-3d} can be visualized easily in two dimensions by projecting the
three-dimensional trajectory of the system onto a plane. I show the
attractor in the $x$/$z$ plane in \cref{fig:lorenz}, and I use this projection throughout this dissertation whenever I compare ESN or NVAR output to the true Lorenz attractor.

\section{R{\"{o}}ssler}\label{sec:rossler}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/rossler-3d}
  \caption{The true R{\"{o}}ssler attractor, produced by integrating \cref{eq:rossler}.}%
  \label{fig:rossler-3d}
\end{figure}

%  \caption{The true R{\"{o}}ssler attractor projected on to the $x$/$z$ plane.}
%  \label{fig:rossler}
%\end{figure}

The R{\"{o}}ssler system is described by
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \dot{x} &= - y - z, \\
    \dot{y} &= x + a y, \\
    \dot{z} &= b + z (x - c),
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:rossler}
\end{equation}
with standard parameters $a = 0.2$, $b = 0.2$, $c =
5.7$~\cite{rossler1976}. The attractor of this system is visualized in
\cref{fig:rossler-3d}.

The $z$ component of this system mostly stays near zero, with rare
positive spikes. This makes prediction with an ESN difficult. To make
this component of the system more suitable for ESN prediction, I use
$\log z$ instead for both ESN input and prediction output.

\section{Double-Scroll}\label{sec:dscroll}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/dscroll-3d}
  \caption{The true double-scroll circuit attractor, produced by integrating \cref{eq:dscroll}.}%
  \label{fig:dscroll-3d}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/dscroll}
  \caption{The true double-scroll circuit attractor projected on to the $V_1$/$I$ plane.}%
  \label{fig:dscroll}
\end{figure}

The double-scroll chaotic circuit is described by the dimensionless equations
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
   \dot{V_1} &= \frac{V_1}{R_1} - \frac{V_1 - V_2}{R_2} - 2 I_r \sinh\left(\alpha(V_1 - V_2)\right), \\
   \dot{V_2} &= \frac{V_1 - V_2}{R_2} + 2 I_r \sinh\left(\alpha(V_1 - V_2)\right) - I, \\
   \dot{I} &= V_2 - R_4 I,
 \end{aligned}
 \label{eq:dscroll}
\end{equation}
with parameters $R_1 = 1.2$, $R_2 = 3.44$, $R_4 = 0.193$, $I_r = 2.25
\times 10^{-5}$, and $\alpha = 11.6$~\cite{gauthier1996}. The
attractor of this system is depicted in \cref{fig:dscroll-3d}. As
with the Lorenz system, for comparison purposes I will use a
projection of the attractor on to the $V_1$/$I$ plane, depicted in
\cref{fig:dscroll}.

\section{Mackey-Glass}\label{sec:mackey-glass}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/mackey-glass}
  \caption{The true Mackey-Glass attractor represented as a time delay embedding using $\tau$ as the delay, produced by integrating \cref{eq:mackey-glass}.}%
  \label{fig:mackey-glass}
\end{figure}

The Mackey-Glass system is described by the time-delay differential equation
\begin{equation}
  \dot{u}(t) = \beta \frac{u(t - \tau)}{1 + u(t - \tau)^n} - \gamma u(t),
  \label{eq:mackey-glass}
\end{equation}
with standard parameters $\beta = 0.2$, $\gamma = 0.1$, $\tau = 17$,
$n = 10$~\cite{mackey1977}. The attractor of this system is most
commonly visualized as a time-delay embedding of the trajectory, using
$\tau$ as the delay parameter, as depicted in \cref{fig:mackey-glass}.
