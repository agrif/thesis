This is the LaTeX source of my dissertation, "Essential Reservoir Computing."

For the paper, compile `./thesis.tex`. For the presentation, compile
`./presentation/presentation.tex`.

I recommend using makelatex:

The presentation uses a font and some logos I do not have the rights
to redistribute. It will compile fine without them, but see also
`logos` and `proxima` inside the `presentation` directory.
