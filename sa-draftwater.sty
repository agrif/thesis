% Description: Provides commands for placing ``DRAFT'' watermark on
%              pages. It works with pdftex and allows one to choose 
%              which pages to watermark. Existing packages do not 
%              do both as far as I know.

% Future Improvements:
%  - draft and final options (when loading graphicx)
